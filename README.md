### Problem Statement :
The purpose of this task is to:

Define proper KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover
Create a visualisation for the HR manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance indicators(KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

**Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:**

* Number of men
* Number of women
* Number of leavers
* % employees promoted (FY21)
* % of women promoted
* % of hires men
* % of hires women
* % turnover
* Average performance rating: men
* Average Performance rating: women
### Datasource :
Dataset used for this task was presented by Pwc and Diversity and Inclusion dataset:

**Dataset: Diversity and Inclusion**

# Data Preparation:
Completed the Data transformation in Power Query and the dataset loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for modeling.

Diversity and Inclusion dataset is give table named:

Diversity and Inclusion dataset which has 500 rows and 31 Column of observation
Data Cleaning for the dataset was done in the power query editor as follows:

Changed the header row of dataset
Replaced the value is New hire FY20? N coverted No and Y converted Yes
Replaced the value is In base group for turnover FY20 N coverted No and Y converted Yes
Replaced the value is Promotion in FY20? N coverted No and Y converted Yes
Removed Unnecessary columns
Removed Unnecessary rows
Each of the columns in the table were validated to have the correct data type

## Data Analysis (DAX):
**Measures used in all visualization are:**

* #of leavers = CALCULATE(COUNTA('HR Manager'[Employee ID]), 'HR Manager'[Leaver FY] IN { "FY20" })

* #of men =Calculate(distinctcount('HR Manager'[Employee ID]),Filter('HR Manager','HR Manager'[Gender]="Male"))

* #of women = Calculate(distinctcount('HR Manager'[Employee ID]),Filter('HR Manager','HR Manager'[Gender]="Female"))

* % employees promoted (FY21) =Divide(Calculate(distinctcount('HR Manager'[Employee ID]),Filter('HR Manager','HR Manager'[Promotion in FY21?]="Yes")),Calculate(distinctcount('HR Manager'[Employee ID]),Filter('HR Manager','HR Manager'[In base group for Promotion FY21]="Yes")))

* % of hires men = Divide('HR Manager'[# of men],('HR Manager'[# of men]+'HR Manager'[# of women]))

* % of hires women = Divide('HR Manager'[# of women],('HR Manager'[# of women]+'HR Manager'[# of men]))

* % Promotees who were men = Divide(Calculate(distinctcount('HR Manager'[Employee ID]),Filter('HR Manager','HR Manager'[Gender]="Male")),distinctcount('HR Manager'[Employee ID]))

* % Promotees who were women = Divide(Calculate(distinctcount('HR Manager'[Employee ID]),Filter('HR Manager','HR Manager'[Gender]="Female")),distinctcount('HR Manager'[Employee ID]))

* % Turnover = Divide(Calculate(distinctcount('HR Manager'[Employee ID]),Filter('HR Manager','HR Manager'[FY20 leaver?]="Yes")),Divide(Calculate(distinctcount('HR Manager'[Employee ID]),Filter('HR Manager','HR Manager'[In base group for turnover FY20]="Y"))+Calculate(distinctcount('HR Manager'[Employee ID]),Filter('HR Manager',NOT('HR Manager'[Department @01.07.2020]=BLANK()))),2))

* Avg Rating Men = Calculate(Average('HR Manager'[FY20 Performance Rating]),Filter('HR Manager','HR Manager'[Gender]="Male"))

* Avg Rating Women = Calculate(Average('HR Manager'[FY20 Performance Rating]),Filter('HR Manager','HR Manager'[Gender]="Female"))

Average speed of answer
Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
### Datasource :
Dataset used for this task was presented by Pwc and call centre trends dataset:

**Dataset: Call Centre Trends**

## Data Preparation:
Completed the Data transformation in Power Query and the dataset loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for modeling.

### Insights:
**As shown the data Visualization, It can be deduced that:**

* Customers on the Two-Year contract, have been with the company for long, while most of the customers on Month-to-Month contract joined the company.
* The company is at risk of losing recently joined customers. based on the results from analysis.. if they decided to month-to-month contract.
* 7043 customers are at the risk of churn. and The churn rate is 27% and yearly charges is $16.06M charges. and Monthly Charges is $456.12K monthly charges.
* 2955 tech tickets were opened and 3632 admin tickets were opened.
* Most of the churned customers did not sign up for Online Security and tech support and also did not sign up for Phone Services.
* It a lot of customers had an issue with Fiber Optic . Up to 42% of the customers churned were using Fiber Optic as their Internet Services.

**Recommendation:**

The Company could try convincing customers to subscribe to One-Year and Two-Year contract. The contract are not favorable to customers as they tend to pay more monthly.
Giving the discount to customers based on the some specific tasks is also good wat retaining them, specially those month-to-month contract.
From analysis majority customers who churned did not sigh up for Online Security and Tech Support. These are the important services that customers should customers signup for. The company should educate customers on the benefits of signing up for these services.
Increase sale of 1 and 2 year contract by 5% each and Yearly increase of automatic payments by 5%.
